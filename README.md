using React Testing library, testing the user experience as per RTL. So tests are on the Dashboard component

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\

# On the Beach Frontend Software Engineer code test

Produce a HTML, CSS and JavaScript representation of the given `design.png` with the following features:

- Sort the results by price (this should be the default)
- Sort the results by star rating and highlight when active
- Sort the results alphabetically by hotel name and highlight when active
- Ability to toggle expanded hotel description

We are looking for a client side solution, there should be no server logic involved.

Feel free to use JavaScript libraries or frameworks. Imagine this will be a component added to a large website.

You may use things like CSS Preprocessors and JavaScript build tools, but if you do please include the dependencies/source files.
Feel free to source your own icons.

Things we like:

- Semantic HTML
- Modular CSS
- Error/warning free JavaScript
- Tests
- Clean flow of state throughout the application
