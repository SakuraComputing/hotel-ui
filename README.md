# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

React version 18.2
React Redux Toolkit for state management
React Testing Library for Tests

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

using React Testing library, testing the user experience as per RTL. So tests are on the Dashboard component

### Notes on testing

I would use a mock store for testing in a real project not the actual store. There are no where near enough tests but I have spent a lot of time on this.

## Oustanding Problems

//Functional
Re-rendering - useSelector needs to be memoized somehow
Tests not sufficient

// Styling
Fonts and Colours need more time on them
SASS/CSS needs refactoring
Rating needs empty stars removing
Button text color too light
Read more about the hotel chevron needs sorting
Occupants numbers not in bold
Nothing in for responsiveness or mobile
No icons on the sort radio buttons

## Notes

I have done everything by rule of thumb styling wise, I would expect the design team to give exact designs down to pixel level, colours and assets.
TIt has been enjoyable doing this
