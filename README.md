# On The Beach

### Tech Test Repository.

## Build Notes

React 18\
Typescript\
Redux Dev Tools

## Installation

**npm install**

## Start

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

I have done everything by rule of thumb styling wise, I would expect the design team to give exact designs down to pixel level, colours and assets.

## Testing

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### Notes on testing

I would use a mock store for testing in a real project not the actual store. There are no where near enough tests but I have spent a lot of time on this.

Used React Testing library testing the user experience as per RTL. So tests are on the Dashboard component

## Further improvemments

### Functional

Re-rendering - useSelector needs to be memoized
Tests not sufficient

### Styling

Fonts and Colours need to be more accurate\
Rating needs empty stars removing\
Button text color too light\
Read more about the hotel chevron needs sorting\
Occupants numbers not in bold\
Nothing in for responsiveness or mobile\
Sorting not bi-directional\
